### Version 1.6

New update to the bot, version 1.6:

# 🛠️ Fixed:

Fixed a bug in /help

Updated help

# 📂 Added:

Added the section of Slash Commands in  /help

?slowmode (Need permission to: manage messages)

?chat (It is used to ask things to a modified version of chat-gpt)

?generate_image (It is used to get image to a beta version of DALL-E [the images last less than 24h])

?translate (translates text into any supported language)

Now the bot during code issues or update has maintenance status

# ❌ Removed:

I removed the version of help that is used with '?'

I removed the ?activity command (due to discord adding that you need nitro to use it and no more boost to the server)
